# Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning.


## Projects

In this project aims to study electricity consumption in Thailand (monthly) in the past 22 years during 2002 to 2023. I have use Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) to handle the seasonality and ARIMA model for forecasting.

In this project aims to study cryptocurentcy ETHUSD price. I will uses ARIMA and SARIMAX for building the forecasts model.

This study is concerned with applying an Expectation â€“ Maximization algorithm (EM algorithm) for estimating parameters in a normal mixture model. We show how to apply the EM algorithm for estimating parameters in the normal mixture model with two components by using R programming.
