# Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning.


## Projects

In this project aims to study electricity consumption in Thailand (monthly) in the past 22 years during 2002 to 2023. I have use Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) to handle the seasonality and ARIMA model for forecasting.

In this project aims to study cryptocurentcy Ethereum (ETHUSD) price data from Yahoo Finance. I will uses ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors) for building the ETHUSD price forecasts model by using Python.

This study is concerned with applying an Expectation â€“ Maximization algorithm (EM algorithm) for estimating parameters in a normal mixture model. We show how to apply the EM algorithm for estimating parameters in the normal mixture model with two components by using R programming.
